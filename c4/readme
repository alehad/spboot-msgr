# spboot-msgr
Spring Boot Messenger App

What is this:
Simple REST WebService that allows for creating/updating/deleting of simple messages:

{
   "message": "a message",
   "author": "the author"
}

Folders:

c4 > contains c4 diagram of the app

devops > docker > contains docker images for running app or required docker images [mongo/kakfa/etc] locally

  > msgr-docker-compose.yml - docker compose file for running all required components + the app itself
  >
  > to run full app locally: 
  >
  > 	docker compose -f msgr-docker-compose.yml up [/down] 
  > 
  >
  > other compose files are useful for running locally some/all services needed when developing app:
  >
  > msgr-pipeline-services-compose.yml - docker compose file for running all required services locally


jenkins > contains the shell script for running jenkins locally  

k8> same as devops folder but containg the k8 deployment files


Running/developing the app:

When developing the app, the easiest way to run all supporting services is via docker compose:

  > docker compose -f msgr-pipeline-services-compose.yml up

once this is running, run the msgr project via Debug Configurations --> create Messenger-dev config [which in Arguments tab has --spring.profiles.active=dev ]

this will ensure that app uses /resources/application-dev.properties file, which overrides all properties needed to run/debug the app locally

Postman is a typical way to test the application, the following end-points are used depending on the mode of running:

  * localhost:8088 if debugging via IDE [for example, in Postman GET http://localhost:8080/messages]

  * localhost:8088 if running in K8s/minikube
  
  * localhost:8080 if running fully in docker [via docker compose -f msgr-docker-compose.yml up]


Docker:

Docker deployment supports both Redis and ES cache configurations, as well as persistence for Mongo, Redis and ES.

Service names for Kafka and ES are driven by the idiosyncrasies of K8s kafka and ES deployments, which are present at least in minikube.

  * Naming kafka service simply kafka will cause 'port is deprecated. Please use KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS instead.' fail message, due to K8s internal env variable settings which use service name.

  * Default ES http service in K8 minikube is elasticsearch-es-http, so the same service name for ES was also used for docker compose service definition. 


K8s:

K8 deployment supports ES cache and MongoDB implementation, and provides ES persistance via ECK setup.
At present, there is no MongoDB persistence and Redis cache implementation.


Mongo Express:

If admin authentication is needed on the first run of the app, see: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express

under: 'The following are only needed if ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN is "false"'.


Azure:

App can be deployed to Azure via 'multi-container docker compose' feature in AppService setup. 

Use msgr-docker-compose.yml to define the compose config. Use 'docker hub' option for image location [no need to store in Azure registry].

IMPORTANT:

Once you create the AppService as per above, you need to tell Azure which container is the 'main' container, or 'web' container in Azure parlance.

You also need to define port mapping, if your service is not running on default port 80 or 8080 [in our case, service is running on 8088 within container].

Azure will scan the containers to see if any services within them have open 80/8080 port internally and will assign that container to be the web container.

Msgr app service opens internally port 8088, and even though this is mapped to external 80/8080 ports, it is not enough for Azure to recognise it.

So, in Configuration section of the AppService, the following settings need to be specified:

	WEBSITES_PORT = 8088 [this will redirect all incoming traffic to 8088 port]
	WEBSITES_WEB_CONTAINER_NAME = msgr [this identifies the main/web container to which traffic should be directed]


App:

The web service is designed to allow easy addition of different technologies for learning purposes.

Adding support for instance for SQLServer as a message store would require:
  * Implementing SQLServerStore class that extends InitializableComponentRegistry<IMessageStore>
  * setting the property msgr.db.store=SQLServer in application.properties file

Similar to this, different message brokering technologies could also be introduced.

Kafka implementation in the app is a simple 'sync' implementation, whereby the KafkaMessageBroker will handle both posting
and processing of the kafka topics.

This app is not intended for any other use except for learning purposes.
